Upon launch, the Samples project shows a list of options:

1. Shows a default Android context menu, populated with a menu resource xml
2. Shows a CDMenu populated with a menu resource xml
3. Shows a CDMenu populated with a Menu object
4. Shows a CDMenu populated with a menu resource xml, containing several layers of submenus
5. Shows a CDMenu with its ListView inflated from a custom layout resource xml file
6. Shows a CDMenu with its ListView set by passing in the object
7. Shows a CDMenu with its ListView items' layout inflated from a custom layout resource xml file
8. Same as 7, but also handles a callback to manually update custom list items, used in case their layouts need more than just main TextViews to be updated
